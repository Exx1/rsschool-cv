## About me
I am 26 years old and now i am working as a marketer in the large company selling trucks. Given recent events, most of the European brands with which our company worked are leaving the Russian market so i am thinking about changing my profession and now is the right time to do it.

I like to do computers, learn new technologies related to PC components. I like to spend different tests as with hardware as with programs (Although i can often break something but on the other hand i can understand how it works)

Having tried to start learning programming, I began to gradually get involved in this process and with each new lesson the desire does not fade away and I constantly want to learn something and do something in practice, there is no feeling that I am "working" and I like it the most.
